# JourneyGPT

JourneyGPT is an travel companion powered by LLM agent system. The core of the system utilizes Ollama and Llama3.2, a state-of-the-art local large language model (LLM) designed for on-device inference. This ensures high performance while maintaining data privacy, as all computations and decision-making processes occur locally on the user's device.

By leveraging Ollama Llama, JourneyGPT provides personalized and context-aware responses, offering real-time itinerary planning, dynamic user memory management, and seamless interaction. This architecture allows the application to function efficiently even in low-connectivity environments, ensuring a consistent and agent-driven user experience.

JourneyGPT also ensures that **user data is securely stored in a Neo4j graph database**. User preferences and memories are retained, allowing the system to prefill trip details and suggestions when the user returns. This personalized approach creates a seamless and intuitive experience for repeat users, saving time and enhancing satisfaction.


A key feature of JourneyGPT is its integrated chatbot. This chatbot  handles user queries by either:
1. **Calling specific backend functions**: For tasks like itinerary generation, weather fetching, or event discovery, the chatbot routes the query to predefined APIs or models to deliver accurate, actionable results.
2. **Using its own knowledge base**: If a query falls outside the predefined functions, the chatbot directly responds based on its extensive training, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

By combining the power of localized LLM inference with dynamic function execution, JourneyGPT ensures fluid interactions, making travel planning effortless and intuitive.

## Features
- **User Preferences and Memories**: Personalized travel suggestions using Neo4j for memory and preference storage.
- **Itinerary Generation**: Generate customized itineraries based on user interests, budget, and time constraints.
- **Weather Integration**: Real-time weather forecasts for better planning.
- **Local Events Discovery**: Find events in your chosen destination.
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Visualize destinations on an interactive map.
